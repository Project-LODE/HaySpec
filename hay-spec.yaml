    title: Introduction and Front Matter

    definition: >
      Introduces the hay specification's purpose, scope, and intended usage.
      Provides context for its development, importance, and structure, including
      audience, terminology, and field naming conventions.

    narration: |
      Hay is a foundational agricultural commodity, essential to the nutrition
      of dairy and beef cattle, horses, goats, camels, sheep, and other animals.
      In the United States, hay ranks among the leading cash crops by annual
      sales value, alongside corn, wheat, and soybeans. Yet unlike those crops,
      hay is traded entirely on an over-the-counter basis -- through
      peer-to-peer negotiation, dealers, or brokers -- without common product
      definitions or standardized digital tools.

      The hay market does not inherently require centralized exchanges to
      function well. But it does suffer from two critical deficiencies: buyers
      and sellers struggle to find one another efficiently, and there is limited
      electronic facilitation of trading, particularly in matching,
      documentation, and decision support.

      These limitations stem in part from the lack of shared standards. Without
      consistent product descriptions or data conventions, hay listings and
      negotiations rely on informal descriptions, resulting in persistent
      mismatches in perceptions of quality, weak price signals, and high
      friction in trade. This hinders regional and global commerce, limits
      market transparency, and slows investment in modern tools for production,
      logistics, testing, and quality control.

      Efforts to standardize hay go back more than a century. As recently as the
      late 19th century, centralized hay markets operated in cities such as
      Boston, Chicago, and San Francisco. Since then, producer groups, academic
      institutions, extension agencies, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture
      have all proposed grading systems. But none has achieved enduring,
      widespread adoption.

      Several developments now offer new opportunities for progress. Hay exports
      are growing, especially alfalfa, which now trades across borders under
      increasingly formalized standards. Testing technologies have matured,
      including laboratory-based wet chemistry and near-infrared reflectance
      (NIR) spectroscopy. Digital tools and platforms are emerging, enabling
      traceability from field to bale. Online infrastructure allows global
      coordination, opening the door for community-led standards and
      interoperability.

      This document proposes a formal product definition for hay -- a structured
      data model that captures economically salient characteristics in a
      consistent format. Such a definition supports better listings, search,
      comparison, and traceability. Over time, it may also surface replacements
      in market behavior that inform the development of accepted grading
      practices.

      This is a working draft subject to field testing and stakeholder
      refinement. Planned additions include a reference dataset of forage
      varieties with identifiers and metadata, and a registry of forage analysis
      laboratories supporting the specified testing methods and protocols.

  - id: location
    title: Field Location and Growing Environment

    definition: >
      Specifies the geographic and environmental setting of the field or
      production area, including identifiers, region, climate, and proximity to
      known environmental risks. Aids in understanding growing conditions and
      risk factors.

    narration: |
      This section describes the field location and environmental
      characteristics where the hay was produced. Geographic factors play a
      significant role in hay quality, influencing aspects such as nutrient
      content, texture, and palatability. Elevation, climate classification, and
      irrigation infrastructure all shape growing conditions and harvesting
      outcomes.

      These fields support traceability, enable regional comparisons, and help
      buyers assess how site-specific factors may affect hay performance for
      their intended use.

    fields:
      - id: hay_origin
        title: Hay origin
        data_type: object
        required: true

        fields:
          - id: country_code
            title: Country code
            data_type: enum
            required: true
            enum_select_mode: single
            valid_values_ref: country_codes
            enum_source:
              id: country_codes
              uri: references/country_codes.yaml
              version: 0.1.0

            definition: >
              Specifies the country in which the hay was produced, using the
              standardized ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code.

            narration: |
              This field enables consistent identification of the national
              origin of the hay. It supports traceability, regulatory
              compliance, and buyer transparency.

              Standardized country codes simplify reporting, reduce ambiguity,
              and allow system-level filtering, sorting, and cross-border
              analysis.

              System interfaces may implement dropdown menus or auto-complete
              tools linked to an ISO country code list to reduce input errors.

            validation_guidance: |
              Must be a valid 2-letter ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code (e.g.,
              `US`, `CA`, `MX`).

          - id: subdivision_code
            title: Subdivision code
            data_type: enum
            required: true
            enum_select_mode: single
            valid_values_ref: subdivision_codes
            enum_source:
              id: subdivision_codes
              uri: references/subdivision_codes.yaml
              version: 0.1.0

            definition: >
              Specifies the first-level administrative region associated with
              the hay's origin, using the ISO 3166-2 code format.

            narration: |
              This field identifies the state, province, or regional unit where
              the hay was grown. The ISO 3166-2 format includes the country code
              followed by a hyphen and a regional code (e.g., `US-TX` for
              Texas).

              Use of subdivision codes supports consistent traceability,
              regional reporting, and compatibility with compliance and
              geographic datasets.

              System interfaces may enable filtering by region after a country
              code is selected to reduce input errors and simplify workflows.

              A small number of countries, e.g., Singapore, do not have
              subdivisions and will take a value of `not_applicable` from the
              `subdivision_codes` reference list.

            validation_guidance: |
              - Must be a valid ISO 3166-2 subdivision code (e.g., `US-TX`, `CA-ON`).
              - For countries with no defined subdivisions, use `not_applicable`.
              - The list of valid values is maintained in the `subdivision_codes` reference list.

          - id: county_code
            title: County code
            data_type: enum
            required: true
            enum_select_mode: single
            valid_values_ref: county_names
            enum_source:
              id: county_names
              uri: references/county_names.yaml
              version: 0.1.0

            definition: >
              Identifies the county, parish, district, or equivalent
              subnational unit in which the hay was grown. This field uses a
              controlled vocabulary where possible.

            narration: |
              This field captures localized geographic origin below the
              state or provincial level. It supports regulatory programs,
              extension reporting, and region-specific marketing.

              The field draws from a reference list of recognized counties
              or equivalents (e.g., U.S. counties, Canadian census divisions).
              For cases outside the reference list, select `other` and provide
              the actual value using `county_code_other`.

              Together with `country_code` and `subdivision_code`, this field
              contributes to full traceability of hay production location.

            validation_guidance: |
              - Allowed values are defined in `county_names.yaml`.
              - For U.S. entries, select a recognized county from the list.
              - If the county is not in the list, select `other` and supply the actual name in `county_code_other`.
              - Do not enter free-text values directly in this field.

          - id: county_code_other
            title: County code (other)
            data_type: string
            required: false
            max_length: 100

            definition: >
              Provides the actual county, parish, or district name when the
              selected `county_code` is `other`.

            narration: |
              This field allows sellers to specify a geographic unit not
              found in the controlled list, such as a foreign region or
              subnational area outside the U.S. or Canada.

              It ensures that valid traceability is still possible even when
              the controlled list is incomplete.

            validation_guidance: |
              - This field is required if `county_code` is `other`.
              - Maximum length: 100 characters.
              - Do not use this field unless `county_code` equals `other`.

          - id: postal_code
            title: Postal code
            data_type: string
            required: false

            definition: >
              Captures the postal code (or ZIP code) for the location where the
              hay was grown.

            narration: |
              This field provides highly localized origin data that supports
              logistics, mapping, and regulatory compliance.

              Postal codes vary by country -- for example: 90210 (United
              States), K1A 0B1 (Canada), 75008 (France).

              Used in combination with country, subdivision, and county fields,
              the postal code contributes to full geographic traceability.

              Systems may optionally validate format against the selected
              country or enable auto-complete to improve accuracy.

            validation_guidance: |
              - Postal or ZIP code.
              - Free-text field. Maximum length: 20 characters.
              - Must align with format conventions of the associated country.

          - id: field_name
            title: Field name
            data_type: string
            required: false

            definition: >
              Name or label used by the producer to identify the field or block
              from which the hay was harvested.

            narration: |
              This value can help associate the hay lot with operational field
              names in farm records, maps, or traceability systems. Use plain,
              concise naming.

              If the hay was sourced from more than one field, use the keyword
              `multi_field`.

              A blank value does not imply multiple fields.

            validation_guidance: |
              - Maximum length: 100 characters.
              - Do not use formatting, special characters, or markup.
              - If using the keyword `multi_field`, then `hay_single_lot_traceable` must be set to `false`.

          - id: field_id
            title: Field ID
            data_type: string
            required: false

            definition: >
              Internal or external identifier used to uniquely reference the
              field or block where the hay was grown.

            narration: |
              This may be a grower's internal ID, a land parcel number, or a
              geographic reference used in farm management software. Use
              consistent formatting where applicable.

              If the hay was sourced from more than one field, use the keyword
              `multi-field`.

              A blank value does not imply multiple fields.

            validation_guidance: |
              - Maximum length: 100 characters.
              - Use plain text only.
              - If using the keyword `multi-field`, then `hay_single_lot_traceable` must be set to `false`.

                  version: 0.90

            definition: >
              Elevation of the field, measured as height above or below sea level.

            narration: |
              Elevation can affect forage species suitability, yield, and nutrient density
              due to climatic and soil influences. Provide the average elevation of the
              production field.

              Systems should offer a selector for units (`m`, `ft`) to reduce input errors.

              Valid input range:
                - Feet: -300 to 13000 ft
                - Meters (approximate equivalents): -91 to 3962 m

              Values outside these ranges warrant review.

            validation_guidance: |
              - `units` must be either `m` (meters) or `ft` (feet).
              - `magnitude` must be a whole number representing elevation in the selected units.
              - Bounds by unit:
                - If `units` == `ft`: `magnitude` must be between -300 and 13000.
                - If `units` == `m`: `magnitude` must be between -91 and 3962.
              - Values below 0 represent locations below sea level.
              - Cross-validate elevation against location fields if desired.
              - Note: The `valid_range` on `magnitude` corresponds to feet. Enforce the per-unit
                bounds above at input time to ensure consistency.

            definition: >
              Records the generalized climate classification for the field where
              the hay was grown, using the Koppen-Geiger system.

            narration: |
              This field provides environmental context about the hay's
              production zone using a widely recognized climate classification
              system.

              Examples:

              - `Cfa` -- Humid subtropical (e.g., Southeastern U.S.).
              - `BSk` -- Cold semi-arid (e.g., High Plains).
              - `Dfb` -- Humid continental, warm summer (e.g., Upper Midwest).

              Koppen-Geiger codes reflect key climatic factors like temperature
              patterns and precipitation. Including this data helps agronomists
              and buyers interpret forage characteristics, growing season
              dynamics, and crop risk profiles.

            validation_guidance: |
              - Must be a valid 2- to 3-letter Koppen-Geiger climate code (e.g., `Cfa`, `BSk`, `Dfb`).
              - Values are case-sensitive.

                validation_guidance: |
                  Valid values: `acres`, `hectares`. Required when an area
                  magnitude is given.

            definition: >
              Total land area of the production field. Report the numeric value
              (`field_area_magnitude`) together with its unit
              (`field_area_units`).

            narration: |
              Captures the size of the field or parcel from which the hay was
              harvested. Field area is relevant for assessing yield per unit
              area, validating production claims, and understanding operation
              scale.

              Describes the general irrigation context in which the hay was
              grown.

            narration: |
              This field indicates whether irrigation was necessary, optional,

  - id: soil
    title: Soil and Field Management
    definition: >
      Summarizes field-level soil characteristics and management practices, such
      as pH, amendments, drainage, and compaction. These factors affect forage
      nutrient uptake, yield potential, and long-term field performance.

    narration: |
      This section captures how the grower prepares and maintains the soil to
      support a healthy forage stand. It includes information about fertilizer
      applications, soil amendments, and general nutrient management.

      These practices influence crop yield, plant vigor, and nutritional quality
      of the harvested hay. They also help downstream users assess environmental
      practices, sustainability, and alignment with production goals, such as
      high-protein dairy forage versus lower-input grazing hay.

      Where applicable, fields differentiate between nutrient application to
      legume and grass crops -- acknowledging, for example, that nitrogen is
      often unnecessary for legumes due to biological nitrogen fixation.

        narration: |
          Soil pH affects nutrient availability, microbial activity, and overall
          crop performance. Most forage crops perform best when soil pH is
          between 6.0 and 7.5. Legumes such as alfalfa benefit from pH levels
          above 6.5.

          This value should reflect a recent, lab-confirmed soil test. Buyers
          and agronomists may use this value to assess forage quality risk,
          nutrient uptake potential, and whether liming or fertility adjustments
          may have been needed.

    title: Stand Composition and Agronomic Characteristics

    definition: >
      Describes the agronomic characteristics of the hay stand at the time of
      harvest, including species composition, maturity, establishment method,
      and density. Helps contextualize forage quality and production conditions.

    narration: |
      This section describes the planted forage stand -- the biological and
      agronomic foundation of the hay crop. It includes the intended composition
      of plant varieties, their representation in the harvested hay, and related
      agronomic details such as establishment method, density, and maturity at
      harvest.

      These fields support transparency around crop planning, species selection,
      and cultural practices, helping buyers assess the identity, uniformity,
      and development stage of the forage. The section also captures information
      relevant to quality, palatability, and intended use, and it helps
      agricultural professionals interpret how the hay's characteristics relate
      to field management decisions.

    fields:
      - id: stand_mixture_intended
        title: Intended as mixture
        data_type: boolean
        required: false

        definition: >
          Indicates whether the forage stand was intentionally planted as a
          mixture of two or more species or varieties (polyculture) rather than
          a monoculture.

        narration: |
          This field captures the grower's original intent at the time of stand
          establishment. A value of `true` reflects an intentional mix (e.g.,
          alfalfa and timothy), while `false` indicates a monoculture was
          intended.

          Note that actual harvest outcomes may differ due to environmental or
          agronomic factors. For example, if a grower plants a mix but only one
          species survives, this field would still be `true` based on intent.

          This field pairs with `forage_variety_count` and
          `forage_variety_components` to describe the diversity of the stand and
          with `forage_type_classification` to indicate the botanical
          composition at harvest.

        validation_guidance: |
          - Valid values: `true`, `false`.
          - Should be `true` when `forage_variety_count` > 1.
          - May be used to trigger checks for presence of multiple `forage_variety_components`.

          Categorizes the harvested forage crop by its dominant biological type
          or mix, such as grass, legume, or a mixed stand-based on what was
          present at the time of harvest.

        narration: |
          This field captures the observed biological classification of the
          forage in the harvested hay, regardless of what was originally
          planted.

          - `grass` -- Composed primarily of grass species (e.g., bermudagrass, timothy, orchardgrass).
          - `legume` -- Composed primarily of legumes (e.g., alfalfa, clover).
          - `grass_legume_mix` -- Contains both grass and legume species in significant proportion.
          - `other` -- Contains significant components not classified as grass or legume (e.g., brassicas, forbs).
          - `unknown` -- Type cannot be determined or was not assessed.

          This classification informs nutritional modeling, feeding decisions,
          and market expectations. It complements other stand-level details such
          as maturity, density, and variety composition.

        validation_guidance: |
          - Must be one of the values defined in `forage_type_classification.yaml`.
          - Required for nutritional modeling and maturity interpretation.
          - Cross-check with `forage_variety_components` and `stand_maturity_at_harvest` to ensure internal consistency.

          Reports how many distinct forage varieties were identified in the
          actual harvested crop.

        narration: |
          This field supports both marketing claims (e.g., "two-variety blend")
          and technical functions, such as determining how many entries of
          `forage_variety_components` should be included in a structured record.

          A value of `0` should be used when no species or varieties can be
          positively identified. In such cases, `forage_type_classification`
          must be set to `unknown`.

          In monocultures, use `1`. In mixed stands, use `2` or more. Most
          common values are between 1 and 4.

        validation_guidance: |
          - Must be a whole number from 0 to 10.
          - `0` is only valid if `forage_type_classification` is `unknown`.
          - If `forage_variety_components` are listed, their count must match this value.
          - If `stand_mixture_intended` is `false`, this value should typically be `1`.

          hay.

        narration: |
          Use one entry for each forage variety intentionally seeded or
          established. This component supports agronomic transparency and aligns
          with `stand_mixture_intended` and `forage_variety_count`.

          Include both the target contribution (e.g., expected mix ratio at
          planting) and the actual observed contribution (e.g., estimated
          harvest ratio). This allows comparisons between planned and actual
          stand composition.

            narration: |
              This field captures the grower's intended composition of the stand
              by assigning a proportional weight to each variety in the mixture.

              If all varieties are intended to contribute equally, the same
              value can be used for each (e.g., 1, 1, 1). Interpretation depends
              on the distribution of values across all components in the same
              mixture.

              This proportional method enables flexible modeling of
              multi-variety stands without requiring percentages or strict
              totals.

            validation_guidance: |
              - Must be a whole number between 1 and 100.

            narration: >
              This field represents the observed or estimated contribution of a
              specific forage variety to the harvested hay. Unlike the target
              value, this result is typically determined through visual
              inspection, post-harvest scouting, or lab analysis.

              It allows comparison between intended and actual stand outcomes
              and may inform future planning or support quality assurance and
              marketing claims.

                the mature stand.
              - Result values may differ from targets due to establishment
                variability, competition, or reseeding.
              - The total across all varieties should be approximately 100%

          supports nutritional modeling, quality grading, and feed planning.

        narration: |
          Different species use different maturity scales. For example:

          - Grass hays may be classified as vegetative, boot, heading, flowering, or mature.
          - Alfalfa hays may use terms such as early bud, late bud, full bloom, or post bloom.

          This field should be selected based on the predominant crop type and
          maturity at harvest. When more than one species is present, use the
          best descriptor for the overall stand maturity.

        validation_guidance: |
          - Valid values are referenced externally via the `stand_maturity_codes` list.

          A qualitative assessment of how thick or complete the forage canopy
          was at the time of harvest.

        narration: |
          This field captures the observed density of the forage stand at
          harvest. Higher density often indicates better productivity and more
          effective weed suppression.

          - `sparse` -- Thin coverage with visible gaps or bare soil.
          - `moderate` -- Typical coverage with average uniformity.
          - `dense` -- Lush and uniform canopy with few or no gaps.
          - `unknown` -- Density was not assessed or cannot be reported.

          Stand density provides useful context for interpreting forage quality,
          yield potential, and management history.

        validation_guidance: |

          Reports the number of full growing seasons the stand has been in
          production before harvest.

        narration: |
          This field indicates the age of the forage stand in completed growing
          seasons at the time of harvest. For example, a new seeding harvested
          in its first year should be recorded as `0`.

          Stand age can influence species persistence, yield potential, and
          nutrient demand. Younger stands may yield less or show dominance by
          aggressive species, while older stands may thin or shift in botanical
          composition.

          Understanding stand age supports agronomic planning and quality
          assessment, especially when paired with maturity, density, and
          establishment method.

        validation_guidance: |
          - Must be a decimal number between 0 and 50.
          - Use `0` for new plantings harvested in their establishment year.

          Indicates the typical or intended growth stage at which the forage crop is
          cut, based on grower practice or management goals.

        narration: |
          This field records the growth stage at which the grower intends to cut the
          forage crop. The selected stage influences fiber content, digestibility,
          protein concentration, and overall feed value. Cutting earlier often improves
          quality but reduces yield; later stages boost yield but may lower palatability.

          The reported stage reflects agronomic practice or marketing preference, not
          necessarily what was achieved at harvest. For example, a grower may aim for
          boot stage in grasses or early bloom in alfalfa.

          This field is distinct from `stand_maturity_at_harvest`, which captures the
          observed maturity at the time of cutting.

        validation_guidance: |
          - Allowed values are drawn from the `stand_maturity_codes` reference list.
          - Only values with `typical_use_context: intended_stage` should be used.
          - Species-specific validation may use the `forage_type` metadata in the reference list to ensure consistency with `forage_species_type`.

      wrapping materials, and labeling. Essential for logistics, compatibility
      with handling equipment, and product identification.

    narration: |
      This section describes the physical form in which the hay is currently
      packaged for sale or shipment. It includes bale dimensions, binding
      material, compression method, and other packaging details that affect
      storage, transport, handling, and customer preferences.

      Packaging specifications may differ from original harvest conditions --
      particularly in cases where hay has been rebaled or processed after the
      initial cutting. Buyers rely on this data to assess compatibility with
      feeding systems, freight capacity, and regulatory or market requirements.

      Note: Some hay may be reprocessed or rebaled after the initial harvest.

              Specifies the axis of a round bale, measured from flat face to
              flat face.

            narration: |
              The axis is the lengthwise measurement of a round bale and,
              together with diameter, defines its full dimensions. This
              measurement is important for modeling storage density, wrapping
              needs, and fitting bales into transport systems.

              - Must be a decimal number between 20.0 and 190.0.
              - Units are defined by `bale_dimension_units`.
              - Applies only to bales with `bale_shape` of `round`.
              - Typical round bale axis lengths range from 60 to 72 inches (152 to 183 cm).
              - For rectangular bales, this field should be left blank or omitted.

  - id: traceability
    title: Traceability

    definition: >
      Defines how the hay can be traced back to its origin, including internal
      and external lot identifiers and optional field-to-bale mapping. Supports
      logistical transparency, documentation, and regulatory compliance.

    narration: |
      This section captures whether the hay can be traced to a clearly defined production lot and
      whether formal identifiers exist that facilitate lot-level tracking, recall, or certification.

      Traceability is increasingly important in high-value or regulated markets, as it supports
      inventory segregation, quality assurance, documentation of origin, and post-sale issue
      resolution. It enables sellers to demonstrate chain of custody, buyers to verify source
      conditions, and all parties to manage logistics and compliance more effectively.

        definition: >
          Affirms whether the hay being described originates from a single, defined lot, harvested under uniform agronomic and environmental conditions.

        narration: |
          A lot is defined as forage taken from the same farm, field, and cut, harvested and stored under uniform conditions within a 48-hour period, as described in Ball et al. (2001).
          This designation supports clarity in nutritional representation, quality assessment, and logistical consistency. Where hay is mixed across cuts, fields, or harvest conditions,
          the value should be `false`.

        validation_guidance: |
          - Valid values: `true`, `false`.
          - Use `true` only if all bales included in the described unit meet the lot definition without exception.

              This field allows the seller to assign an internal identifier to the lot from which the hay originated.

            narration: |
              The internal identifier may reflect farm, field, cutting, or date conventions relevant to the seller's operation. It does not need to conform to any industry standard but
              should be unique within the seller's system.

              It may be used for inventory management, customer reference, and traceability across quality or testing modules.

                  This field records the externally issued lot identifier assigned to the hay or forage lot by a regulatory, certifying, or export authority.

                narration: |
                  External lot identifiers may appear on documents such as:

                  - Organic certificates (e.g., USDA NOP Lot #12345)
                  - Phytosanitary inspection reports
                  - Export documents or permits
                  - Weed-free forage program tags or declarations

                  The value may include letters, numbers, or a combination thereof. Systems should preserve the identifier exactly as provided by the issuing body, including any dashes,
                  slashes, or formatting symbols.

                  This field enhances traceability and may support validation workflows, especially in regulated or export-focused markets.

              species considered a contaminant or quality concern.

            narration: |
              This field allows sellers to disclose specific weed species that
              were present in the stand or baled material. Weed presence can
              affect hay marketability, feed quality, and animal health.

              Even small amounts of certain weeds may be a problem in sensitive
              contexts such as equine operations or export shipments. Buyers
              may use this information to assess weed tolerance or need for
              further inspection.

              When `toxic_plants_present` is marked `true`, the relevant toxic
              species should be included in this list if known.

                  production field. Drawn from a standardized list of plant
                  species that are considered agronomically undesirable due to
                  factors such as invasiveness, toxicity, or marketability impact.

                narration: |
                  Accurate weed species disclosure helps buyers evaluate risk
                  related to feed quality, animal safety, and compliance with
                  regulatory or export standards. The reference list includes
                  species classified as noxious, invasive, or toxic, as well as
                  commonly encountered field weeds.

                  The list is periodically updated and designed to support
                  downstream filtering, highlighting, and warnings in technical
                  systems. Each species is tagged with metadata flags that may
                  influence handling or buyer decisions.

            narration: |
              Some plant species contain toxic compounds that can be harmful or
              fatal to animals. These include, but are not limited to, species
              such as hoary alyssum, bracken fern, johnsongrass (with nitrates),
              water hemlock, and locoweeds. This field helps buyers assess
              safety risks associated with the forage.

              Sellers should answer `true` if any potentially toxic plants were
              identified in the stand or harvested bales, regardless of quantity.
              When set to `true`, supporting detail should be provided in
              the `weed_species_present` or a supplemental notes field.

          Captures a structured, sequential record of the hay's handling,
          storage, and transfer stages from baling to delivery or final
          inspection. Each entry represents one distinct handling event or
          storage condition and may include up to eight fields describing the
          conditions, structures, and effects present at that stage.

        narration: |
          Hay quality and condition can be significantly influenced by how the
          product is handled after baling. This field enables producers,
          merchants, and buyers to document and assess the chain of custody,
          storage conditions, and environmental exposures that may affect
          product value.

          The handling sequence may include on-farm storage, restacking,
          transloading, warehouse storage, in-transit pauses, and final delivery
          conditions. Each entry may contain up to eight fields: `stage_label`,
          `location_type`, `duration_estimate`, `storage_structure`,
          `surface_type`, `airflow_condition`, `restacked`, and
          `storage_degradation_visible`.

          Entries may be descriptive or partial depending on information
          availability. Transparency about the post-baling journey helps build
          trust, supports dispute resolution, and aligns with quality assurance
          protocols in regulated or export contexts.

        validation_guidance: |
          - Must be a list of structured entries representing the handling and storage sequence from baling to delivery.

    definition: >
      Contains results from laboratory analysis of forage nutrient content,
      including protein, fiber, minerals, digestibility, and energy metrics.
      Used to evaluate feeding value and compliance with nutritional targets.

    narration: |
      This section captures laboratory test results and related metadata for the
      hay's nutritional profile. These metrics help buyers evaluate forage
      quality and suitability for various animal classes.

      When available, forage analysis results supplement visual observations and
      support data-driven ration formulation. Fields cover whether the hay was
      tested, how the sample was processed, and selected analytical values.

    validation_guidance: |
      - Certain laboratory results may return the special value `trace`, indicating that an analyte was detected but not present at a reliably quantifiable concentration.
      - `trace` is permitted only for specific fields, such as `chloride_ion`, and must be explicitly listed in that fields valid values.
      - Use `trace` to distinguish between non-detection and sub-threshold detection; do not substitute `0.00`.
      - Numeric values, when used, should reflect results above the detection threshold and typically include up to two decimal places.
      - This approach supports clarity in interpreting low-level results without compromising numeric integrity in other fields.

              Indicates whether the individual or entity that collected the hay
              sample was independent of the seller.

            narration: |
              A value of `true` indicates the sample was taken by a third party
              -- such as a certified lab technician, consultant, or extension
              agent -- with no financial interest in the hay sale.

              A value of `false` means the sample was collected by the seller or
              someone affiliated with the seller.

              Use `unknown` when the sampler's identity or affiliation is not
              known. This distinction can influence buyer confidence in the
              impartiality of lab results, especially in regulated feed programs
              or high-value transactions.

              certified or formally trained in forage sampling techniques.

            narration: |
              A value of `true` means the sampler held a recognized
              certification or had formal training in standardized forage
              sampling procedures -- such as using a coring probe and collecting
              samples from multiple bales.

              A value of `false` indicates the sample was collected by someone
              without documented training or certification.

              Use `unknown` if the samplers qualifications are not known.
              Certification status can influence confidence in the samples
              quality and the reliability of lab results, particularly in
              regulated or quality-assured programs.

          These two fields form the backbone of forage analysis, affecting
          nutritional calculations, storage decisions, and feed formulation
          across all classes of livestock.

              The percentage of the sample's total weight that consists of
              water. Moisture content is the inverse of dry matter and plays a
              critical role in hay storage, preservation, and nutritional
              calculations.

            narration: |
              Forage testing labs may measure moisture content directly or
              calculate it by subtracting dry matter from 100%. Moisture content
              is also used to convert other nutrient values between "as-fed" and
              "dry matter" basis. While this specification records moisture
              content explicitly, dry matter may be calculated separately when
              needed. A value of 100% would represent pure water and is not
              realistic in hay samples.

              A positive decimal value representing the dry matter content of
              the hay sample, expressed as a percentage. Dry matter is the
              portion of the forage that remains after all moisture has been
              removed.

            narration: |
              Dry matter includes all nutrients -- such as fiber, protein,
              minerals, and energy -- and is the standard basis for comparing
              feeds and formulating rations. Values below 85% may suggest
              elevated moisture and increased risk of spoilage or spontaneous
              heating. All nutrient values are typically reported on a dry
              matter basis to eliminate dilution effects from water and ensure
              comparability across feed types.

            validation_guidance: |

        title: Forage quality indexes

        definition: >
          Contains standardized forage quality indexes derived from fiber and
          energy content to evaluate feed value across hay types.

        narration: |
          This group includes widely used forage indexes that summarize the
          hay's overall quality for feeding purposes.

          Relative Feed Value (RFV) estimates intake potential and digestibility
          based on ADF and NDF values, while Relative Forage Quality (RFQ)
          improves upon RFV by incorporating fiber digestibility. These indexes
          allow buyers, nutritionists, and producers to compare hay lots
          consistently and determine suitability for specific livestock classes
          or feeding programs.

            definition: >
              A positive decimal value representing the Relative Feed Value
              (RFV) of the hay sample. RFV is a standardized index used to
              estimate overall forage quality based on digestibility and
              potential intake, calculated from ADF and NDF values.

            narration: |
              Relative Feed Value (RFV) is calculated using the formula: RFV
              equals Dry Matter Intake percent times Digestible Dry Matter
              percent divided by 1.29. The scale is normalized so that
              full-bloom alfalfa scores 100. Higher values suggest improved
              animal performance due to greater digestibility and intake
              potential. Example classifications include: greater than 150 is
              considered excellent; 125 to 150 is good; 103 to 124 is fair; 87
              to 102 is poor; less than 87 is reject or very low quality. RFV
              does not account for fiber digestibility differences among forages
              and is being replaced in many contexts by Relative Forage Quality
              (RFQ), which provides a more accurate assessment.

            validation_guidance: |
              - Must be a positive decimal between 70.0 and 240.0.
              - Relative Feed Value (RFV) is a dimensionless index used to evaluate forage quality based on ADF and NDF.
              - Most hay falls between 100 and 180. Values above 185 indicate very high-quality dairy forage.

            definition: >
              A positive decimal value representing the Relative Forage Quality
              (RFQ) of the hay sample. RFQ is an enhanced forage index that
              estimates overall feed value by incorporating both potential
              intake and fiber digestibility.

            narration: |
              Relative Forage Quality (RFQ) improves upon Relative Feed Value
              (RFV) by using Total Digestible Nutrients (TDN) instead of Acid
              Detergent Fiber (ADF) and by incorporating Neutral Detergent Fiber
              Digestibility (NDFD), when available. It is calculated using a
              formula such as RFQ equals Dry Matter Intake percent times Total
              Digestible Nutrients percent divided by 1.23. Dry Matter Intake is
              based on NDF, and TDN is based on ADF and NDFD. RFQ provides a
              more accurate assessment of feeding value, particularly for
              grasses, mixed forages, and forages with high fiber digestibility.
              Like RFV, it is scaled so that full-bloom alfalfa scores 100.
              Example classifications include: greater than 170 is prime; 150 to
              170 is premium; 130 to 149 is good; 100 to 129 is fair; and less
              than 100 is low quality. RFQ is now the preferred index in many
              extension and laboratory reports, especially when NDFD is measured
              or predicted.

            validation_guidance: |
              - Must be a positive decimal between 70.0 and 240.0.
              - Relative Forage Quality (RFQ) improves on RFV by incorporating digestible fiber and is considered more accurate for grass and mixed forages.
              - Most hay falls between 100 and 200.

        narration: |
          This group includes calculated energy values used in ration balancing for ruminants. It reflects the NRC 2001 model structure, with values such as Digestible Energy (DE),
          Metabolizable Energy (ME), and Net Energy for Lactation, Maintenance, and Gain (NEL, NEM, NEG). Each is presented in both pounds and kilograms to support U.S. and international
          feeding systems.

          Total Digestible Nutrients (TDN) is included as a legacy metric for estimating energy availability. These values are critical for livestock performance modeling and feed
          efficiency optimization.

              of the hay sample in megacalories per pound (Mcal/lb), calculated
              at maintenance-level intake (1X).

            narration: |
              Digestible Energy (DE) is calculated as the gross energy of the
              forage minus fecal energy losses. It is an intermediate measure
              used before metabolizable and net energy estimates. This value is
              expressed in megacalories per pound of feed on a dry matter basis.
              The 1X designation refers to maintenance-level intake, meaning it
              does not account for energy demands from lactation, growth, or
              work. Higher DE values indicate better digestibility and energy
              availability. DE is used in ration formulation for animals such as
              horses, beef cattle, and sheep.

              (ME) of the hay sample in megacalories per pound (Mcal/lb),
              calculated at maintenance-level intake (1X).

            narration: |
              Metabolizable Energy (ME) is calculated as Digestible Energy (DE)
              minus energy lost as gases, primarily methane, and in urine. It
              represents the portion of energy available for maintenance and
              productive functions in the animal. The 1X label refers to
              maintenance-level intake, meaning this energy value does not
              include adjustments for added metabolic demand such as lactation
              or growth. ME is typically expressed in megacalories per pound on
              a dry matter basis and is commonly used in ration formulation for
              ruminants and equines. It also serves as the basis for calculating
              net energy values.

              - Must be a decimal between 0.70 and 1.15.
              - Metabolizable energy at maintenance (ME_1x) accounts for urinary and gaseous energy losses.
              - Most hay falls between 0.90 and 1.20 Mcal/lb.
              - Values above 1.30 are rare and usually reflect highly digestible forage or misreported data.

              level (3X).

            narration: |
              Net Energy of Lactation (NEL) estimates the portion of energy in forage available for milk production after subtracting all energy losses, including those from feces, urine,
              gases, and heat increment. The 3X designation refers to dry matter intake at three times the maintenance energy requirement, which reflects typical consumption patterns in
              lactating dairy cows. This standardization improves the comparability of NEL values across forages. NEL is expressed in megacalories per pound on a dry matter basis and is
              widely used in dairy ration formulation to estimate energy supply and milk yield potential.

            narration: |
              Net Energy of Maintenance (NEM) quantifies the portion of forage energy available to meet an animal's basic metabolic functions such as respiration, circulation, and
              temperature regulation. The 3X label indicates energy availability at an intake level three times higher than basic maintenance requirements, aligning with standardized feeding
              models for comparability. NEM is used primarily in beef cattle and sheep ration formulation to estimate whether the forage provides adequate baseline energy supply. It is
              expressed in megacalories per pound on a dry matter basis.

            narration: |
              Net Energy of Gain (NEG) estimates the portion of energy in forage that is available for body weight gain after meeting maintenance energy needs. It accounts for energy lost as
              feces, urine, gases, heat, and maintenance metabolism. The 3x designation standardizes intake to three times maintenance level, reflecting expected consumption in growing beef
              cattle and optimizing comparability across forages. NEG is a critical value in formulating rations for weight gain and finishing programs. It is expressed in megacalories per
              pound on a dry matter basis.

            narration: |
              Digestible Energy (DE) measures the energy available in forage after subtracting fecal energy losses from gross energy content. The 1X designation indicates the estimate is
              based on intake equivalent to one times the maintenance energy requirement, consistent with NRC standards. This field expresses DE in megacalories per kilogram to support
              metric-based and international ration formulation. While U.S. systems commonly use Mcal/lb, Mcal/kg values are standard in global livestock nutrition.

              Metabolizable Energy (ME) represents the amount of energy available to the animal after subtracting fecal, urinary, and gaseous losses from the Digestible Energy (DE) of the
              forage. This value is expressed in megacalories per kilogram to support metric-based feeding systems. The 1X designation reflects intake at maintenance energy levels, in line
              with assumptions used in NRC 2001 models for ruminants. Most hays provide between 1.6 and 2.3 Mcal/kg of ME on a dry matter basis. This value is essential for comparing forage
              sources in international and metric ration formulation contexts.

            narration: |
              Net Energy for Lactation (NEL) represents the energy available from forage for milk production, after subtracting all losses from feces, urine, gas, and heat increment. This
              field expresses that value in megacalories per kilogram to support metric-based feed systems. The 3X label reflects a standardized dry matter intake level equivalent to three
              times maintenance, as used in NRC 2001 energy modeling. This intake assumption supports comparability across forages and feeding programs. Most hays fall between 1.3 and 1.8
              Mcal/kg NEL on a dry matter basis. Higher values indicate greater energy density and are typically associated with earlier-cut or legume-rich forages appropriate for lactating
              animals.

            narration: |
              Net Energy for Maintenance (NEM) is the portion of forage energy available to sustain essential functions such as thermoregulation, circulation, and tissue maintenance. It is a
              foundational energy metric used in both beef and dairy nutrition models. The 3X designation reflects an assumed intake level at three times the maintenance requirement,
              following NRC 2001 energy modeling conventions. This field expresses NEM in megacalories per kilogram to support metric-based and international nutrition systems. Forage
              samples typically range from 1.1 to 1.6 Mcal/kg NEM. Higher values indicate better energy efficiency for livestock maintenance needs and are often observed in early-cut or
              legume-rich forages.

            narration: |
              Net Energy for Gain (NEG) estimates the portion of forage energy available for body weight gain, including both muscle and fat deposition, after maintenance energy needs have
              been met. This value is reported in megacalories per kilogram on a dry matter basis to support metric-based feeding systems. The 3x designation follows NRC 2001 modeling
              standards, assuming dry matter intake at three times the maintenance requirement. Most forages range between 0.55 and 1.3 Mcal/kg NEG. Higher values reflect greater energy

            narration: |
              Total Digestible Nutrients (TDN) estimates the total amount of
              digestible fiber, protein, lipid, and carbohydrate in a forage. It
              is a key indicator of the forage's overall energy content. The 1x
              designation refers to an intake level equal to one times the
              animal's maintenance requirement, consistent with NRC 2001
              modeling standards. TDN is expressed as a percentage of dry
              matter. Most hay samples fall between 50 and 70 percent TDN.
              Higher values suggest greater energy availability and typically
              result from earlier harvests and more digestible forage
              components.

        narration: |
          This group provides a detailed profile of forage protein quality and
          availability. It includes total crude protein and subdivides it into
          fractions representing soluble, degradable, and indigestible
          components. These values are essential for balancing rations based on
          rumen degradability and metabolizable protein supply.

          Understanding these fractions helps nutritionists formulate diets that
          match animal requirements, minimize waste, and improve feed
          efficiency, particularly in high-performance or sensitive livestock
          systems.

              AF) basis.

            narration: |
              Crude Protein (CP) estimates the total protein content of forage
              by multiplying the measured nitrogen content by a factor of 6.25.
              This estimate includes both true protein and non-protein nitrogen
              (NPN) compounds.

              Crude protein is a foundational measure in forage analysis and
              livestock ration formulation. It helps determine whether a forage
              meets the dietary protein requirements of various animal classes,
              including maintenance, growth, reproduction, and lactation.

              Typical CP values for grass hays range from 6% to 12% on a dry
              matter basis, while legume hays such as alfalfa may range from 15%
              to 25% depending on maturity and management. Forages with CP below
              7% are unlikely to support adequate microbial activity in the
              rumen and may require supplementation.

            validation_guidance: |
              - Crude protein values should be reported as a percentage on a dry matter and/or as-fed basis.
              - Values below 5% may indicate overly mature or weathered forage and are typically deficient.
              - Values between 6% and 12% are common in grass hays; values from 15% to 25% are common in legume hays.
              - Values above 28% are rare and may reflect immature legumes or laboratory anomalies.

            narration: |
              Available protein represents the fraction of crude protein (CP)
              that remains digestible and absorbable by the animal after
              subtracting heat-damaged or indigestible nitrogen. It is commonly
              estimated as crude protein minus acid detergent insoluble crude
              protein (ADF-CP).

              Available protein provides a more accurate assessment of the true
              nutritional value of forage protein, particularly for hays
              affected by harvest moisture, overheating, or mold. Damage from
              rain or excessive storage heat can reduce protein availability
              through Maillard reactions and protein-fiber binding.

              Grass hays typically contain 4% to 9% available protein on a dry matter basis. High-quality legume hays may reach 14% to 17%, depending on harvest maturity and handling.

            narration: |
              Acid Detergent Insoluble Crude Protein (ADICP), also known as
              ADF-CP, is the fraction of crude protein that is tightly bound to
              the acid detergent fiber (ADF) fraction and largely indigestible.
              It often results from heat damage during harvest or storage and is
              not usable by ruminants.

              ADICP is subtracted from total crude protein to calculate
              available protein. Well-cured hay generally has ADICP levels below
              2%. Values above 3% may indicate rain exposure, excessive
              maturity, or overheating -- each of which can significantly degrade
              forage quality even if crude protein appears high.

              Interpreting ADICP alongside crude and available protein helps
              assess actual nutritional value and detect hidden losses in forage
              quality.

              A structured field reporting the adjusted crude protein (ACP)
              content of the forage sample, expressed on a dry matter (% DM)
              and/or as-fed (% AF) basis.

            narration: |
              Adjusted Crude Protein (ACP) is a refined measure of total forage
              protein, subtracting indigestible fractions such as acid detergent
              insoluble crude protein (ADICP or ADF-CP). It reflects the portion
              of protein that is actually usable by the animal and provides a
              more accurate indicator of nutritional value than crude protein
              alone.

              ACP is typically calculated as crude protein minus ADICP. It is
              closely related to "available protein," though the two terms may
              differ depending on lab methodology or modeling system. Most hays
              show ACP values 1 to 3 percentage points lower than crude protein.
              Weather-damaged or heat-affected hay may exhibit larger gaps.

              Reporting ACP supports improved ration formulation, especially
              when feeding ruminants with high-quality or compromised hay.

            validation_guidance: |
              - Must be a decimal between 3.0 and 26.0.
              - Adjusted crude protein removes indigestible protein fractions (e.g., ADICP) to better estimate usable protein.
              - Typically 1-3 points below total CP; values above 26% are uncommon.
              - Should be consistent with CP and ADICP values: ACP = CP - ADICP.

              A structured field reporting the neutral detergent insoluble crude
              protein (NDICP) content of the forage sample, expressed on a dry
              matter (% DM) and/or as-fed (% AF) basis.

            narration: |
              Neutral Detergent Insoluble Crude Protein (NDICP) refers to the
              portion of crude protein bound within the plant cell wall, as
              measured during neutral detergent fiber (NDF) analysis. This
              fraction includes both indigestible and slowly digestible protein
              linked to cell wall components.

              NDICP is generally higher than acid detergent insoluble protein
              (ADICP), as it includes all protein associated with the fiber
              matrix, not just the most resistant portion. Its value is useful
              for estimating rumen-undegradable protein (RUP) and metabolizable
              protein contributions, particularly in mature or weathered forage.

              Elevated NDICP levels may indicate excessive fiber, delayed
              harvest, or heat damage. Proper interpretation is essential in
              formulating rations for animals with high protein requirements or
              limited rumen degradation time.

              - Must be a decimal between 1.0 and 10.0.
              - NDICP includes both digestible and indigestible fiber-bound protein.
              - Typical hay values range from 0.5% to 1.5%; values above 2.5% suggest maturity, damage, or poor curing.
              - Should be compared with ADICP and crude protein for consistency.

              of CP).

            narration: |
              Soluble Protein is the fraction of crude protein that dissolves
              rapidly in rumen fluid and becomes quickly available for microbial
              fermentation. It includes non-protein nitrogen (NPN), peptides,
              amino acids, and some true protein. This field expresses soluble
              protein as a percentage of the total crude protein content.
              Typical values for hay range from 15 to 40 percent of CP. Higher
              values reflect faster ruminal degradation and may lead to nitrogen
              imbalances if not supported by sufficient fermentable energy.
              Soluble protein is an important component of degradable intake
              protein and is often used in formulating balanced rations to
              support optimal microbial protein synthesis in ruminants.

              - Must be a decimal between 15.0 and 50.0.
              - Soluble protein is the rapidly available fraction of crude protein. It plays a key role in microbial growth and rumen function. Most forages range from 30-60%. Values above
              70% are uncommon and may suggest high NPN or sampling error.

              content of the hay sample, expressed as a percentage of crude
              protein (% of CP).

            narration: |
              Degradable Protein, also referred to as Ruminally Degradable
              Protein (RDP), is the portion of crude protein that is broken down
              in the rumen into ammonia, peptides, and amino acids. This
              fraction supports microbial protein synthesis and helps drive
              efficient fermentation. The value is expressed as a percentage of
              total crude protein and includes soluble protein as a subset,
              along with more slowly degradable true protein components. Forages
              generally contain 30 to 80 percent degradable protein relative to
              CP. When degradability is very high, diets may require
              supplementation with rumen undegradable protein (RUP) to ensure
              balanced nitrogen and energy availability.

            validation_guidance: |
              - Must be a decimal between 40.0 and 85.0.
              - Degradable protein represents the portion of total crude protein that is broken down in the rumen. Most grass hay ranges from 55-70%, and alfalfa from 65-80%. Values below

          protein balancing and support accurate formulation of performance
          rations for dairy, equine, and specialty livestock systems.

          Amino acid profiling may be particularly relevant in high-value hay

            narration: |
              Lysine is an essential amino acid important for growth, muscle
              development, immune function, and milk production in livestock.
              Forages vary in lysine content depending on species, maturity at
              harvest, and preservation conditions. Alfalfa and legumes tend to
              contain more lysine than grasses.

              This field enables reporting of lysine concentration either on a
              dry matter basis (`% DM`) or as fed (`% AF`). Dry matter values

        narration: |
          This group characterizes the forage's carbohydrate makeup, including
          fiber fractions and non-fiber carbohydrates. It helps quantify both
          slowly and rapidly fermentable energy sources, guiding ration
          formulation for energy balance and digestive health.

          Structural carbohydrates such as ADF and NDF affect intake and
          digestibility, while non-fiber components such as starch and WSC
          influence fermentation rate and rumen dynamics. These values are
          essential for predicting animal response and optimizing feed
          efficiency.

              A structured field reporting the Acid Detergent Fiber (ADF)
              content of the forage sample, expressed on a dry matter (% DM)
              and/or as-fed (% AF) basis.

            narration: |
              Acid Detergent Fiber (ADF) is the portion of plant fiber made up
              primarily of cellulose and lignin -- the least digestible
              components of forage. ADF is one of the most commonly used fiber
              metrics in forage analysis and is strongly associated with
              digestibility and energy content.

              This field supports reporting of ADF on both a dry matter basis
              (`% DM`) and an as-fed basis (`% AF`). Laboratory results are
              typically obtained via wet chemistry or estimated using Near
              Infrared Reflectance (NIR). Typical ADF values for hay fall
              between 25% and 45% on a dry matter basis.

                  ADF values on a dry matter basis typically range from 25% to
                  45% in most hays. Values above 60% may indicate highly fibrous
                  or weather-damaged forage, while values below 20% are rare and
                  may suggest mislabeling or unusual forage types.

            narration: |
              Neutral Detergent Fiber (NDF) quantifies the total cell wall content of forage, including hemicellulose, cellulose, and lignin. NDF is a key factor in determining forage bulk
              and is a primary constraint on dry matter intake in ruminants. Lower NDF values are generally associated with higher forage quality, greater palatability, and improved intake.

              This field supports NDF concentration reporting on both a dry matter and as-fed basis. Values are typically determined via Near Infrared Reflectance (NIR) spectroscopy or
              standard wet chemistry methods using a neutral detergent solution.

            validation_guidance: |
              - NDF should be reported as a percentage of dry matter (% DM) and/or as-fed (% AF).

                  This value represents the NDF content on a dry matter basis. It reflects the fibrous components of plant material that limit intake in ruminants. Higher NDF values often
                  indicate more mature or stemmy forage. Reported as % of dry matter (% DM), it is a core metric in forage testing.

              A structured field reporting the lignin content of the forage sample, expressed on a dry matter (% DM) and/or as-fed (% AF) basis.

            narration: |
              Lignin is an indigestible polymer found in plant cell walls that provides rigidity and resistance to microbial breakdown. While essential for plant structure, lignin impedes
              digestibility in ruminant diets. Its concentration is strongly correlated with forage maturity and is a key factor in limiting fiber digestibility.

              Lignin values are typically measured via acid detergent lignin (ADL) methods, either by wet chemistry or Near Infrared Reflectance (NIR) analysis. Reporting lignin content on both
              dry matter and as-fed bases supports a full evaluation of forage nutritive value.

            validation_guidance: |
              - Lignin should be reported as a percentage of dry matter (% DM) and/or as-fed (% AF).
              - Typical values for lignin in hay range from 2.0 to 8.0 percent of dry matter.
              - Values below 1.0 or above 10.0 percent may reflect errors in sampling or unusual forage types.
              - Higher lignin levels usually indicate decreased digestibility and lower feeding value.

                  This value represents the lignin fraction of the forage on a dry matter basis. Lignin is highly resistant to microbial digestion and is negatively correlated with digestibility
                  and energy availability. Forages with lower lignin content are typically more digestible and palatable.

            narration: |
              Non-Fiber Carbohydrates (NFC) represent the rapidly fermentable portion of the forage, composed of sugars, starches, pectins, and organic acids. These components are important
              sources of energy in ruminant diets and are more readily digested than fiber-based fractions.

              NFC is typically calculated as the remainder after subtracting NDF, crude protein (CP), fat, and ash from 100 percent of the dry matter. While high NFC forages can boost
              energy density, excessive NFC intake may increase the risk of ruminal acidosis if not properly balanced with effective fiber.

            validation_guidance: |
              - NFC should be reported as a percentage of dry matter (% DM) and/or as-fed (% AF).

              Starch is a non-structural carbohydrate that provides a dense,
              rapidly fermentable source of energy in ruminant diets. It is
              found primarily in cereal grains and small-grain forages,
              especially when harvested at the boot, milk, or dough stages. Most
              grass and legume hays contain very little starch.

              This field supports starch concentration reporting on both dry
              matter and as-fed bases. Laboratory determination typically uses
              wet chemistry methods such as enzymatic hydrolysis or Near
              Infrared Reflectance (NIR) scanning.

            validation_guidance: |
              - Starch should be reported as a percentage of dry matter (% DM) and/or as-fed (% AF).
              - Typical values for hay range from 0.5 to 6.0 percent of dry matter.
              - Values above 10.0 percent are uncommon and may indicate grain contamination or misclassification.
              - For high-starch forage types (e.g., oat hay with immature grain), levels up to 12.0 percent are plausible.

            narration: |
              Water-Soluble Carbohydrates (WSC) are composed primarily of simple
              sugars and some fructans that dissolve in water. These rapidly
              fermentable carbohydrates contribute to the palatability and
              energy density of forage and play an important role in animal
              performance and digestive health.

              WSC levels influence forage suitability for animals with
              carbohydrate sensitivity, such as horses with metabolic disorders.
              In ensiled forages, WSC content affects fermentation quality. WSC
              is typically measured by wet chemistry methods such as ethanol
              extraction and colorimetric assays.

            validation_guidance: |
              - WSC should be reported as a percentage of dry matter (% DM) and/or as-fed (% AF).

            narration: |
              Crude fat represents the ether-extractable fraction of forage, including lipids, fatty acids, waxes, pigments, sterols, and other organic compounds soluble in ether.
              Although forages are not typically rich in fat, this component contributes to the total digestible energy of the diet and may influence palatability and conservation
              characteristics.

              Elevated crude fat levels may occur in forages treated with oil-based additives, ensiled materials, or hay supplemented with lipid-rich components such as oilseeds
              or byproduct feeds. Crude fat is usually measured by laboratory solvent extraction techniques.

              Total Fatty Acids (TFA) represent the proportion of ether-extractable lipids in forage that consists of true fatty acids. This excludes non-nutritive ether-soluble
              compounds such as waxes, pigments, sterols, and essential oils. Because fatty acids contribute directly to energy metabolism, TFA is used in nutritional models to
              estimate Net Energy for Lactation (NEL), Maintenance (NEM), and Gain (NEG).

              TFA is typically measured via laboratory extraction or estimated by applying a multiplier (commonly 0.8) to the crude fat value. TFA is considered a more biologically
              meaningful metric than crude fat in ration formulation.

            narration: |
              Rumen Unsaturated Fatty Acid Load (RUFAL) estimates the concentration of unsaturated fatty acids in forage that may influence rumen fermentation, fiber digestibility,
              and milk fat synthesis. High RUFAL levels can suppress microbial activity and are associated with increased risk of milk fat depression (MFD) in dairy cattle.

              This field is especially relevant in high-producing dairy rations where multiple lipid sources are included. RUFAL is typically calculated from laboratory fatty acid profiles
              and expressed as a percentage of dry matter or as-fed weight, though some labs may report it in grams per kilogram or per 100 grams of DM.

              A structured field reporting the Total Digestible Nutrients (TDN)
              of the forage sample, expressed on a dry matter (% DM) and/or
              as-fed (% AF) basis.

            narration: |
              Total Digestible Nutrients (TDN) is an aggregate estimate of the
              forage's energy value. It combines digestible components of fiber,
              protein, non-fiber carbohydrates, and fat (multiplied by 2.25 to
              account for its higher caloric content). TDN is commonly expressed
              as a percentage of dry matter and is widely used in ration
              balancing, forage evaluation, and comparative feed value
              calculations.

              TDN may be determined through wet chemistry, derived from
              digestibility studies, or predicted using Near Infrared
              Reflectance Spectroscopy (NIR). It is a key indicator of forage
              quality, with higher values reflecting improved nutrient density
              and potential intake.

            validation_guidance: |
              - TDN should be reported as a percentage of dry matter (% DM) and/or as-fed (% AF).
              - Typical values for hay range from 50.0 to 65.0 percent of dry matter.
              - Values below 40.0 or above 70.0 percent are uncommon and may reflect sampling error or misclassification.
              - If TDN is derived from formulas (e.g., summation of digestible nutrients), the methodology should be noted.

            narration: |
              This field represents the Digestible Energy (DE) content of forage for horses, expressed in megacalories per pound of dry matter. DE accounts for the energy available to the
              horse after losses in feces and is the standard energy unit used in equine ration formulation. Typical values vary based on forage type and maturity. Grass hays generally fall
              between 0.80 and 1.00 Mcal/lb, while high-quality alfalfa may exceed 1.15 Mcal/lb. DE may be calculated from nutrient components like TDN or NDF, or derived from empirical
              equations based on equine digestion. This value is used to formulate horse diets according to class-specific energy needs such as maintenance, growth, lactation, or work.

            narration: |
              The kd value represents the fractional rate at which forage dry matter or fiber is digested in the rumen, expressed as the percentage of the component digested per hour. It is
              a dynamic parameter used in ruminant nutrition models to estimate retention time, nutrient availability, and intake potential. Higher kd values reflect more rapidly digestible
              forages, often younger or less lignified. Lower kd values are associated with more mature, weathered, or fibrous material. Measurements are typically obtained through in vitro
              incubation with rumen fluid or estimated using Near Infrared Reflectance (NIR) calibration methods.

            narration: |
              Ash represents the total mineral residue left after complete
              combustion of the forage sample at high temperatures. It includes
              all inorganic material, such as naturally occurring macro- and

              any extraneous matter like soil, sand, or dust that may be
              introduced during harvest and handling.

              While some ash is nutritionally valuable, excess ash -- especially
              from soil contamination -- can reduce the energy density and
              feeding value of forage. Monitoring ash is critical for accurate

            narration: |
              Calcium (Ca) is a critical macromineral involved in skeletal
              development, muscle contraction, nerve transmission, and milk
              production. It is one of the most important minerals for livestock
              health and productivity, especially in dairy cows, young animals,
              and horses.

              Calcium concentrations in forage vary widely by species. Legumes
              such as alfalfa and clover are typically high in calcium, while
              grass hays such as bermudagrass, timothy, and orchardgrass are
              lower. Forage calcium content is usually measured by wet chemistry
              or estimated using Near Infrared Reflectance (NIR).

              Proper calcium levels are essential to prevent metabolic disorders
              such as hypocalcemia (milk fever), bone abnormalities, and poor
              growth.

            validation_guidance: |
              - Calcium should be reported as a percentage of dry matter (% DM) and/or as-fed (% AF).

              basis.

            narration: |
              Phosphorus (P) is an essential macromineral involved in energy
              metabolism, bone formation, reproductive health, and microbial
              growth in the rumen. It plays a key role in the digestion of
              fibrous forages and overall animal performance.

              Phosphorus levels in forage depend on species, maturity stage,
              soil fertility, and harvest conditions. Grass hays typically
              contain 0.15 to 0.35 percent phosphorus, while legume hays like
              alfalfa may range from 0.25 to 0.45 percent. Inadequate phosphorus
              intake can lead to reduced growth, poor fertility, and bone
              disorders.

              Maintaining the proper calcium-to-phosphorus ratio is especially
              important in diets for growing animals, dairy cows, and horses.

            validation_guidance: |

            narration: |
              Magnesium (Mg) is an essential macromineral that plays a key role
              in energy metabolism, nerve impulse transmission, enzyme
              activation, and skeletal development. It is particularly important
              in ruminants, where magnesium deficiency can lead to grass tetany
              (hypomagnesemia) -- a potentially fatal condition.

              Grass hays typically contain 0.10 to 0.25 percent magnesium, while
              legume hays such as alfalfa tend to be higher, ranging from 0.20
              to 0.40 percent. Magnesium levels can be affected by fertilization
              practices, especially when potassium or nitrogen rates are high,
              as these can interfere with absorption. Monitoring magnesium
              content is essential for preventing metabolic disorders in grazing
              and high-performance livestock systems.

              basis.

            narration: |
              Potassium (K) is an essential macromineral required for nerve
              transmission, muscle contraction, osmotic regulation, and
              acid-base balance in livestock. It is also critical for plant
              vigor and regrowth, which is why potassium is often applied as a
              fertilizer.

              Forage potassium levels vary widely depending on plant species,
              soil type, and fertilization practices. Grass hays typically
              contain 1.00 to 3.00 percent potassium, while legume hays often
              range from 2.00 to 3.50 percent. Excessive potassium levels can
              interfere with the absorption of magnesium and calcium, especially
              in periparturient animals, increasing the risk of metabolic
              disorders such as milk fever and grass tetany.

              Accurate measurement of potassium is important when balancing
              diets for transition dairy cows, pregnant livestock, and animals
              on lush or heavily fertilized forage.

              Sulfur (S) is an essential macromineral involved in the synthesis of sulfur-containing amino acids such as methionine and cysteine, as well as the production of
              B-vitamins by rumen microbes. It also supports structural integrity in tissues like wool, hair, skin, and hooves.

              Forage sulfur content varies with species, soil sulfur levels, and fertilization practices. Grass hays generally contain 0.10 to 0.25 percent sulfur on a dry matter basis,
              while legume hays may range from 0.20 to 0.35 percent. Although sulfur is critical for microbial function, excessive intake can lead to neurologic toxicity, particularly
              polioencephalomalacia (PEM), especially in cattle and sheep. Risk increases when total dietary sulfur -- including drinking water and supplements -- exceeds 0.40 percent

            narration: |
              Sodium (Na) is an essential electrolyte that plays a key role in
              fluid balance, nerve impulse transmission, and muscle function. It
              also supports the uptake of other nutrients across cellular
              membranes and helps regulate blood pressure and osmotic balance in
              animals.

              Forage is generally low in sodium, especially when grown on
              low-sodium soils or in regions with high rainfall. Sodium

              matter, though higher levels may occur near coastal areas or with
              salt-based fertilization. Because most forage does not supply
              enough sodium to meet livestock requirements, salt supplementation
              is commonly necessary.

              basis.

            narration: |
              Chloride (Cl⁻) is a negatively charged electrolyte essential for
              maintaining acid-base balance, osmotic pressure, and digestive
              function through the production of hydrochloric acid. It plays an
              especially important role in dairy cattle nutrition due to its
              influence on the Dietary Cation-Anion Difference (DCAD).

              Chloride content in forage varies by plant type, soil salinity, and
              environmental exposure. Most hays contain 0.20 to 0.50 percent
              chloride on a dry matter basis. Levels above 0.60 percent are uncommon
              and may indicate contamination from saline irrigation water, manure,
              coastal spray, or chloride-based fertilizers.

            validation_guidance: |
              - Chloride ion content should be reported as a percentage of dry matter (% DM) and/or as-fed (% AF).
              - Typical values range from 0.20 to 0.50 percent of dry matter.
              - Values below 0.10 or above 0.60 percent are uncommon and may reflect external contamination or testing error.

              A structured field reporting the iron (Fe) content of the forage
              sample, expressed in parts per million (ppm) on a dry matter (%
              DM) and/or as-fed (% AF) basis.

            narration: |
              Iron (Fe) is a trace mineral essential for oxygen transport (as
              part of hemoglobin), cellular respiration, immune function, and
              various enzyme systems. It is typically abundant in forage, and
              deficiencies are rare under normal feeding conditions.

              Most hay samples contain 100 to 500 ppm of iron on a dry matter
              basis. However, excessively high iron levels -- often due to soil
              or dust contamination, rusted harvesting equipment, or iron-rich
              irrigation water -- can interfere with the absorption of copper,
              zinc, and manganese. When total dietary iron exceeds 1,000 ppm,
              supplementation strategies for other trace minerals may need to be
              adjusted.

            validation_guidance: |
              - Iron content should be reported in parts per million (ppm), on a dry matter (% DM) and/or as-fed (% AF) basis.
              - Typical values range from 100 to 500 ppm on a dry matter basis.
              - Values below 50 ppm or above 1,000 ppm are uncommon and may suggest contamination or laboratory error.
              - Iron levels exceeding 1,000 ppm may antagonize copper, zinc, or manganese absorption and should prompt review of total mineral balance.

            narration: |
              Zinc (Zn) is an essential trace mineral required for a wide range
              of physiological processes, including enzyme activity, immune
              system function, skin integrity, reproductive health, and wound
              healing. It also plays a role in hoof structure and epithelial
              tissue maintenance.

              Forage zinc concentrations often range from 20 to 50 ppm on a dry
              matter basis, but levels below 30 ppm are common and may be
              inadequate for optimal animal performance, particularly in young,
              growing, or lactating livestock. High levels of calcium, iron, or
              phytates in the diet can reduce zinc bioavailability.

              Supplementation is commonly needed when dietary zinc levels are
              marginal, especially in intensive production systems.

            validation_guidance: |

            narration: |
              Manganese (Mn) is a trace mineral essential for skeletal
              development, reproductive health, enzyme activation, and
              antioxidant function in livestock. Although manganese is typically
              abundant in forage, its bioavailability is often low and may be
              further reduced by dietary antagonists such as excess calcium,
              phosphorus, or iron.

              Most hay samples contain between 40 and 300 ppm of manganese on a
              dry matter basis. Values below 40 ppm may be insufficient for
              optimal performance in young growing animals, breeding stock, or
              high-producing dairy cows. While manganese toxicity is rare,
              levels above 400 ppm may contribute to trace mineral imbalances
              and warrant consideration when formulating diets.

              matter (% DM) and/or as-fed (% AF) basis.

            narration: |
              Molybdenum (Mo) is a trace mineral required in very small amounts
              for enzyme function in livestock. While essential, molybdenum
              becomes antagonistic at elevated levels due to its interaction
              with sulfur and copper in the rumen.

              High molybdenum levels promote the formation of thiomolybdates,
              which bind dietary copper and reduce its bioavailability -- often
              leading to secondary copper deficiency in ruminants. This is
              particularly concerning in cattle and sheep, especially when
              sulfur content is also high.

              Most forages contain less than 2.0 ppm of molybdenum. Levels above
              3.0 ppm require close monitoring of copper status. Values
              exceeding 5.0 ppm are considered high risk and typically
              necessitate dietary copper adjustment or the use of chelated
              copper supplements.

            narration: |
              Copper (Cu) is a vital trace mineral involved in enzyme
              activation, immune function, iron metabolism, connective tissue
              formation, and coat pigmentation. Copper deficiency is one of the
              most common trace mineral imbalances in forage-fed livestock,
              particularly in regions with high soil or dietary levels of
              antagonistic minerals such as molybdenum, sulfur, or iron, which
              reduce copper bioavailability.

              Most hay samples contain 5 to 15 ppm of copper on a dry matter
              basis. Levels below 8 ppm are often marginal, while values under 4
              ppm are likely deficient for many classes of livestock. Copper
              toxicity is uncommon but can occur in sheep when dietary levels
              exceed 20 to 30 ppm. Accurate monitoring of copper in the context
              of total dietary antagonists is essential for avoiding both
              deficiency and toxicity.

            narration: |
              Selenium (Se) is an essential trace mineral that supports
              antioxidant defense, immune function, thyroid hormone metabolism,
              and muscle health. It is required in extremely small amounts and
              has a narrow range between dietary sufficiency and toxicity.

              Selenium content in forage is highly variable and strongly
              influenced by soil selenium levels. Most forages contain between
              0.05 and 0.30 ppm selenium on a dry matter basis. Values below
              0.10 ppm may result in selenium-responsive disorders such as white
              muscle disease, particularly in young livestock. Levels above 2.0
              ppm are potentially toxic and should be interpreted cautiously,
              especially in sheep and horses.

            narration: |
              Cobalt (Co) is a trace mineral required by ruminants for the
              synthesis of vitamin B12 by rumen microbes. It plays a key role in
              energy metabolism, red blood cell production, and immune function.
              Cobalt deficiencies are most common in sandy, acidic, or heavily
              weathered soils.

              Forage cobalt concentrations typically range from 0.05 to 0.30 ppm
              on a dry matter basis. Levels below 0.10 ppm may impair ruminal
              vitamin B12 synthesis, leading to reduced appetite, poor growth,
              or anemia. Toxicity is rare, even at levels above 1.0 ppm, but
              excessive intake should still be monitored in the context of total
              diet.
